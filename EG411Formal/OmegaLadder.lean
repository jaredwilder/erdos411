# EG#411 (r=2): the ω-ladder — three- and four-prime solutions (2026-06-10)

For `n : ℕ` satisfying `3·φ(n) = 2n + 2` (the Steinerberger/Hercher totient equation that
EG#411 r=2 reduces to — see `RealResult.lean`), we classify the solutions with exactly
three and exactly four prime factors:

  • `solution_three_primes` — if `n = p·q·r` (`p < q < r` primes) then `n = 1295 = 5·7·37`
  • `solution_four_primes`  — if `n = p·q·r·s` (`p < q < r < s` primes) then
                              `n = 1679615 = 5·7·37·1297`

Together with `solution_prime_eq_five` and `solution_two_primes` from
`SolutionStructure.lean`, this matches the brute-force-verified ground truth: the only
solutions with `ω(n) ≤ 4` are `5`, `35`, `1295`, `1679615`.

Proof skeleton (three primes; four primes is the same ladder one rung higher):

  1. Every prime factor is `≥ 5` (`solution_min_prime_ge_five`), and writing
     `p = a+1, q = b+1, r = c+1` turns the equation into the subtraction-free form
     `3·a·b·c = 2·(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) + 2`.
  2. **Cap the smallest prime.** If `p ≥ 11`, then from `10(x+1) ≤ 11x` for each of
     `a, b, c ≥ 10` we get `1000·P ≤ 1331·Q` for `P = (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)`, `Q = abc`;
     with `3Q = 2P + 2` this forces `338·P ≤ 2662`, impossible since `P ≥ 11³`.
     Hence `p ∈ {5, 7}`.
  3. **p = 5:** the equation collapses to `bc = 5b + 5c + 6`, i.e. `(q−6)(r−6) = 31`;
     a linear bound gives `q ≤ 11` and case checking pins `q = 7, r = 37`.
  4. **p = 7:** the equation collapses to `2bc = 7b + 7c + 8`, i.e. `(2q−9)(2r−9) = 65`,
     which has no room above `q > 7`: contradiction.

For four primes the second prime is capped the same way (`6·(16/17)³ > 5` for `p = 5`,
`9·(12/13)³ > 7` for `p = 7` — the `p = 5` margin is razor-thin: `6·(16/17)³ = 5.0048…`),
and the surviving `(p, q)` pairs reduce to two-variable Pell-style factor hunts:
`(r−36)(s−36) = 1261 = 13·97` for `(5,7)` — solved by `r = 37, s = 1297` — and
`(7r−72)(7s−72) = 4687 = 43·109`, `(13r−90)(13s−90) = 6943 = 53·131`, `5 ∤ RHS` walls
for `(5,13)`, `(7,11)`, `(5,11)` respectively.

Fully axiom-free: both theorems report only `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`
(no `native_decide`, no project-local axiom).
