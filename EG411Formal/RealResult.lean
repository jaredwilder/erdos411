# EG#411 (r=2): kernel-checked TRUE results (2026-06-09)

This file formalizes the reduction EG#411 r=2 ⟺ the totient equation, and the structure that
follows. HEADLINES (all kernel-checked):
  • `reduction`        — EG#411 r=2 ⟺ `3·φ(N) = 2N+2`                       (axiom-free)
  • `master_identity`  — every solution has `p = 2·φ(N) − 1`                (axiom-free)
  • `mod8_free`        — the `p ≡ 7 (mod 8)` clause is automatic; it carries (axiom-free)
                         NO information, so the problem is purely primality of `p`
  • `cascade_lemma`    — (in CascadeLemma.lean) `6^(2^j) − 1` solves the eq  (FULLY axiom-free)
                         ⟺ every `6^(2^k) + 1`, `k < j`, is prime
  • `eg411_r2_conditional_closure` — assuming Steinerberger's conjecture,    (no custom axiom)
                         the exceptional primes are EXACTLY `{7, 47}`

EG#411 r=2 is **unconditionally OPEN** (at least as hard as Steinerberger's totient conjecture —
Hercher: any further solution is square-free, has ≥7 prime factors, and is ≥10^14). Nothing
here claims to close it unconditionally. The point is that every step is machine-checked and
there is **NO project-local axiom** — contrast the RETRACTED `cambie_depth3_check` closure
(see `../RETRACTION-EG411-R2-2026-06-09.md`), whose axiom asserted its own conclusion.

Steinerberger (arXiv:2504.08023) reduced the open r=2 question to: does a prime
`p ≡ 7 (mod 8)`, `p > 47`, satisfy `φ((3p−1)/4) = (p+1)/2`?  With `N = (3p−1)/4`
(so `3p = 4N+1`) this is the totient equation `3·φ(N) = 2N+2` studied by Hercher
(arXiv:2504.19915).

Algebraic results below are axiom-free (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound` only).
The concrete computational facts use `native_decide` (adds the standard `Lean.ofReduceBool`).

VERIFIED axiom footprints (`#print axioms`, 2026-06-09):
  reduction, master_identity, mod8_free, telescope, totient_le_sub_one,
  phi_1679615, cascade_solution_1679615  →  {propext, (Classical.choice,) Quot.sound}
      i.e. NO custom math axiom — contrast the RETRACTED `rosser_schoenfeld_1962_thm7_cambie`,
      a project-local axiom that asserted the very conclusion it was used to prove.
  cascade_exceptional_primes and the other native_decide facts  →  the above PLUS the standard
      `native_decide` compiler-trust axiom, on the primality checks only.

/-! ## 7. CONDITIONAL CLOSURE of EG#411 (r=2).

Steinerberger's conjecture — that the totient equation `3·φ(n) = 2n+2` has ONLY the four
solutions `{5, 35, 1295, 1679615}` — is the clean, named, independently-studied open
statement. Hercher (arXiv:2504.19915) proved any further solution is square-free with ≥7
distinct prime factors and `≥ 10^14`; it is verified computationally well beyond that. We do
NOT prove it — that is the number theorists' problem. We prove that **it IMPLIES EG#411 r=2 is
resolved**: the only exceptional primes are 7 and 47. The hypothesis is strictly stronger than
the conclusion and is not a restatement of it (it rules out ALL further totient solutions, even
the ones whose `(4n+1)/3` is composite). This is a genuine conditional theorem, in the same
sense as "assuming RH, …". -/

/-- **Conditional closure of EG#411 (r=2).** Assuming Steinerberger's totient conjecture,
every EG#411 exceptional prime `p` — i.e. every prime with `3p = 4N+1` for a solution `N` of
`3·φ(N) = 2N+2` — is `7` or `47`. -/
