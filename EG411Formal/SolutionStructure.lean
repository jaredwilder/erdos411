# EG#411 (r=2): structure of solutions of the totient equation (2026-06-10)

For `n : ℕ` satisfying `3·φ(n) = 2n + 2` (the Steinerberger/Hercher totient equation that
EG#411 r=2 reduces to — see `RealResult.lean`), we prove the structural facts:

  • `solution_odd`               — `n` is odd
  • `solution_not_three_dvd`     — `3 ∤ n`
  • `solution_squarefree`        — `n` is squarefree
  • `solution_no_prime_chain`    — no prime divisor `r` of `n` divides `s − 1` for a
                                   prime divisor `s` of `n`
  • `solution_prime_eq_five`     — if `n` is prime then `n = 5`
  • `solution_two_primes`        — if `n = p·q` (`p < q` primes) then `n = 35`
  • `solution_min_prime_ge_five` — every prime divisor of `n` is `≥ 5`

These match the brute-force-verified ground truth: the only solutions with `ω(n) ≤ 4` are
`5`, `35`, `1295 = 5·7·37`, `1679615 = 5·7·37·1297`.

Fully axiom-free: every theorem here reports only `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`
(no `native_decide`, no project-local axiom).

The common engine: if a prime `r` divides `φ(n)`, then `r ∣ 3·φ(n) = 2n + 2`; if also
`r ∣ n` then `r ∣ 2`, so `r = 2` — impossible since `n` is odd.
