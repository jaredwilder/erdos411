# EG#411 (r=2): the ω-capstone — classification below five prime factors (2026-06-10)

This file glues the structural ladder (`SolutionStructure.lean`, `OmegaLadder.lean`) to the
conditional-closure apparatus (`RealResult.lean`):

  • `solution_omega_le_four_classified` — every solution of `3·φ(n) = 2n + 2` with
    `ω(n) ≤ 4` is one of `5, 35, 1295, 1679615`.
  • `WeakTotientHypothesis` — the (strictly weaker) hypothesis that every solution has
    `ω(n) ≤ 4`; `weak_implies_conjecture` upgrades it to Steinerberger's full conjecture.
  • `eg411_r2_conditional_closure_sharp` — conditional closure of EG#411 r=2 from the
    weak hypothesis alone: the exceptional primes are exactly `{7, 47}`.
  • `exceptional_high_omega` — **the unconditional headline**: every EG#411 exceptional
    prime other than `7` and `47` comes from a solution `N` with **at least five distinct
    prime factors**.

Proof of the classification: solutions are squarefree (`solution_squarefree`), so
`n = ∏ p ∈ n.primeFactors, p`; cases on `ω(n) ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` feed the sorted prime
tuple to `solution_prime_eq_five` / `solution_two_primes` / `solution_three_primes` /
`solution_four_primes`. For `ω(n) = 4` the minimum prime is split off via `Finset.min'`,
reducing the 24 orderings of four elements to the 6 orderings of three.

The compositeness of the two non-prime candidates `(4·1295+1)/3 = 1727 = 11·157` and
`(4·1679615+1)/3 = 2239487 = 23·97369` is witnessed by explicit divisors, so sections
1–3 — including `exceptional_high_omega` — are fully axiom-free: every theorem there
reports only `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` (no `native_decide`, no
project-local axiom).

**Section 4 (2026-06-10)** pushes the ladder one rung higher via the certified ω = 5
kill-tree (`OmegaTree5.lean`):

  • `solution_omega_le_five_classified` — every solution with `ω(n) ≤ 5` is one of
    `5, 35, 1295, 1679615` (the ω = 5 stratum is empty by `omega5_empty`).
  • `exceptional_high_omega_six` — **the strengthened unconditional headline**: every
    EG#411 exceptional prime other than `7` and `47` comes from a solution `N` with
    **at least six distinct prime factors**.
  • `WeakTotientHypothesis5` / `eg411_r2_conditional_closure_sharp5` — the conditional
    closure now needs only the (strictly weaker) bound `ω ≤ 5` on solutions.

Axiom footprint of section 4: `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}` plus the 33
per-call-site `native_decide` compiler-trust axioms inherited from
`EG411Structure.omega5_empty` (`omega5_empty._native.native_decide.ax_1_*`); no `sorry`,
no project-local axiom. `weak_implies_weak5` alone is native-free.
